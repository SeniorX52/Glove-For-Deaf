**Project Title: Glove for Deaf - Embedded Systems Project**

**Overview:**
The "Glove for Deaf" project is an innovative solution designed to bridge communication barriers for individuals with hearing impairments. Leveraging embedded systems technology, this project utilizes a combination of hardware components and sophisticated software algorithms to translate hand postures into meaningful outputs.

**Features:**
1. **Hand Posture Translation:**
   - The glove is capable of translating up to 50 hand postures, enabling users to convey a wide range of messages and commands.
   - Each hand posture can be calibrated by the user, allowing for personalized mappings of gestures to specific words or actions.

2. **Password Protection:**
   - Users can secure the device with a unique password by performing a predefined hand gesture sequence.
   - The password consists of a 5-digit PIN, providing an additional layer of security.

3. **Operational Modes:**
   - **Speech Mode:** Translates hand postures into understandable English sentences, facilitating communication with non-sign language users.
   - **Control Mode:** Converts hand postures into control outputs, enabling users to interact with external devices such as lamps or buzzers.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - The device interface, displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen, is intuitively designed for ease of use.
   - Navigation is facilitated by three push buttons (Options, Back, Select), offering convenient control over device settings and functionalities.

5. **Profile Management:**
   - Users have the ability to manage profiles directly within the microcontroller, without the need for an external computer.
   - Options include loading existing profiles, calibrating new ones, deleting created profiles, and changing the device password.
  
6. **Bluetooth Connection:**
   - Users have the ability to connect the UART HC-05 bluetooth module to the device and the device will automatically send the data to a bluetooth connected device.

**Hardware Components:**
- **5x Flex Sensors:** Capture hand posture data by converting analog signals into digital values.
- **16x2 LCD Screen:** Displays the device interface and relevant information to the user.
- **3 Push Buttons:** Enable user interaction and navigation through device menus and options.
- **Atmega32 Microcontroller:** The central processing unit responsible for executing software algorithms and managing device operations.
- **EEPROM 24C04A:** Stores user profiles and device settings, ensuring data persistence and accessibility.

**Project Architecture:**
The project follows a modular programming approach, organized within a layered architecture for efficient code management and system scalability. Each module is designed to handle specific functionalities, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

**Conclusion:**
The "Glove for Deaf" project represents a significant advancement in assistive technology, offering a versatile and user-centric solution for individuals with hearing impairments. By combining innovative hardware design with intelligent software algorithms, this project aims to enhance communication accessibility and empower users to express themselves effectively in various contexts.
